## Due date

Application exercises (AEs) are submitted by pushing your work to the relevant GitHub repo. AEs from Tuesday lectures should be submitted by Friday by 11:59pm ET, and AEs from Thursday lectures should be submitted by Sunday at 11:59pm ET. Because AEs are intended for in-class activities, there are no extensions given on AEs.

This AE is due on **Sunday, January 19 at 11:59pm.** To be considered on time, the following must be done by the due date:

-   Final `.qmd` and `.pdf` files pushed to your GitHub repo
-   **Note:** For homeworks and exams, you will also be required to submit your final `.pdf` file submitted on Gradescope
:::

# Introduction

This AE will go through much of the same workflow we've demonstrated in class. The main goal is to reinforce our demo of R and RStudio, which we will be using throughout the course both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the course and to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions.

## Learning goals

By the end of the AE, you will...

-   Be familiar with the workflow using RStudio and GitHub
-   Gain practice writing a reproducible report using Quarto
-   Practice version control using GitHub
-   Perform Gibbs sampling for Bayesian linear regression and compute some basic sumaries

# Getting Started

## Clone the repo & start new RStudio project

-   Go to the course organization at [github.com/biostat725-sp25](https://github.com/biostat725-sp25) organization on GitHub.
-   Click on the repo with the prefix **ae-01-**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the AE.
-   Click on the green **CODE** button, select **Use SSH** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with SSH**). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.
    -   See the [HW 00 instructions](https://biostat725-sp25.netlify.app/hw/hw-00#connect-rstudio-and-github) if you have not set up the SSH key or configured git.
-   In RStudio, go to *File* $\rightarrow$ *New Project* $\rightarrow$ *Version Control* $\rightarrow$ *Git*.
-   Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box *Repository URL*. Again, please make sure to have *SSH* highlighted under *Clone* when you copy the address.
-   Click *Create Project*, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the *Files* pane in RStudio.
-   Click `ae-01-linear-regression.qmd` to open the template Quarto file. This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the AE.

## R and R Studio

Below are the components of the RStudio IDE.

Below are the components of an Quarto (`.qmd`) file.

![](images/quarto.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of Quarto document and rendered PDF." fig-align="center"}

### YAML

The top portion of your Quarto file (between the three dashed lines) is called **YAML**. It stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". It is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.

::: callout-important
Open the Quarto (.qmd) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and render the document. Examine the rendered document.
:::

### Committing changes

Now, go to the Git pane in your RStudio instance. This will be in the top right hand corner in a separate tab.

If you have made changes to your Quarto (.qmd) file, you should see it listed here. Click on it to select it in this list and then click on **Diff**. This shows you the *diff*erence between the last committed state of the document and its current state including changes. You should see deletions in red and additions in green.

If you're happy with these changes, we'll prepare the changes to be pushed to your remote repository. First, **stage** your changes by checking the appropriate box on the files you want to prepare. Next, write a meaningful commit message (for instance, "updated author name") in the **Commit message** box. Finally, click **Commit**. Note that every commit needs to have a commit message associated with it.

You don't have to commit after every change, as this would get quite tedious. You should commit states that are *meaningful to you* for inspection, comparison, or restoration.

In the first few assignments we may tell you exactly when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses we will let you make these decisions.

Now let's make sure all the changes went to GitHub. Go to your GitHub repo and refresh the page. You should see your commit message next to the updated files. If you see this, all your changes are on GitHub and you're good to go!

### Push changes

Now that you have made an update and committed this change, it's time to push these changes to your repo on GitHub.

In order to push your changes to GitHub, you must have **staged** your **commit** to be pushed. click on **Push**.

# R packages

We will begin by loading R packages that we will use in this AE.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)    # data wrangling and visualization
library(tidymodels)   # broom and yardstick package
library(knitr)        # format output
library(skimr)        # quickly calculate summary statistics
library(mvtnorm)      # multivariate normal rng
```

# Data

![Visual Field Assessment](images/Picture1.jpg){fig-alt="vf" fig-align="center" width="75%"}

The data are on patients with glaucoma from the [Rotterdam Ophthalmic Data Repository](http://www.rodrep.com/longitudinal-glaucomatous-vf-data---description.html). Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness world wide with over 60 million glaucoma patients as of 2012. Since impairment caused by glaucoma is irreversible, early detection of disease progression is crucial for effective treatment. Patients with glaucoma are routinely followed up and administered visual fields, a functional assessment of their vision. After each visual field test their current disease status is reported as a mean deviation value, measured in decibels (dB). A lower mean deviation indicates worse vision. An important predictor of disease progression is intraocular pressure (IOP), the pressure of fluids inside your eye. 

We will focus on two variables:

-   `iop`: intraocular pressure, measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg)

-   `progression`: rate of disease progression, measured as the number dB lost per year (dB/year)

The goal of this analysis is to use the IOP to understand variability in disease progression in glaucoma patients. The data is available in the `ae-01-` repo and is called `glaucoma.rds`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#| label: glimpse-data
glaucoma <- readRDS(file = "glaucoma.rds")
glimpse(glaucoma)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
glaucoma <- readRDS(file = "data/glaucoma.rds")
glimpse(glaucoma)
```

# Exploratory data analysis

Let's begin by examining the univariate distributions of the disease progression and IOP. The code to visualize and calculate summary statistics for `progression` is below.

```{r}
#| label: progression-viz

ggplot(data = glaucoma, aes(x = progression)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Disease progression (db/year)", 
       y = "Count",
       title = "Disease progression in glaucoma patients")
```

```{r}
#| label: progression-summary
glaucoma |>
  summarise(min = min(progression), q1 = quantile(progression, 0.25), 
            median = median(progression), q3 = quantile(progression, 0.75), 
            max = max(progression), mean = mean(progression), sd = sd(progression)) |>
  kable(digits = 3)
```

# Posterior estimation

You want to fit a model of the form

$$
progression_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ~ iop_i + \epsilon, \hspace{5mm} \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2).
$$ 

We can obtain samples from the posterior distribution for the regression parameters using the specification from the slides. We define the data objects needed for posterior estimation. Note that the distribution of the outcome has a massive range, so we scale the outcome and predictor to have mean zero and standard deviation one. This will help stabilize inference in the Gibbs sampler. 

```{r}
X <- cbind(1, glaucoma$iop)
Y <- glaucoma$progression
p <- 1
n <- length(Y)
```

We will then define hyperparameters for the priors. We will choose a weakly informative prior.

```{r}
sigma_beta2 <- 10
beta0 <- rep(0, p + 1)
a <- 3
b <- 1
```

We can now obtain samples from the posterior using Gibbs sampling. Let's set $S=5,000$.

```{r}
sigma2 <- exp(rnorm(1)) # initial value
samples <- NULL
for (s in 1:5000) {
  ###Sample from full conditional for beta
  var_beta <- chol2inv(chol(t(X) %*% X / sigma2 + diag(p + 1) / sigma_beta2))
  mean_beta <- var_beta %*% (beta0 / sigma_beta2 + t(X) %*% Y / sigma2)
  beta <- as.numeric(rmvnorm(1, mean_beta, var_beta))
  
  ###Sample from full conditional for sigma2
  quadratic <- as.numeric(t(Y - X %*% beta) %*% (Y - X %*% beta))
  sigma2 <- 1 / rgamma(1, shape = a + n / 2, rate = b + quadratic / 2)
  
  ###Save samples after a burn-in
  samples <- rbind(samples, c(beta, sigma2))
}
```

# Insepction of Gibbs sampler

We can begin by inspecting the posterior density and traceplots.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-height: 3
#| layout-nrow: 2
dat.fig <- data.frame(
  parameter = rep(c("beta[0]", "beta[1]", "sigma^2"), each = 5000),
  index = rep(1:5000, 3),
  value = as.numeric(samples)
)
ggplot(dat.fig, aes(x = value)) +
  geom_density(lwd = 1.5) +
  facet_grid(. ~ parameter, labeller = label_parsed, scales = "free_x") +
  ylab("Density") +
  xlab("Parameter value")
ggplot(dat.fig, aes(x = index, y = value)) + 
  geom_line(lwd = 0.5) + 
  facet_grid(. ~ parameter, labeller = label_parsed, scales = "free_x") + 
  ylab("Parameter value") +
  xlab("Sample index")
```

The traceplots do not exhibit much autocorrelation, indicating we are looking at samples from the posterior.

# Exercises

## Exercise 1

Compute the posterior mean and standard deviation for the intercept, slope, and measurement error. Provide an interpretation for each of these parameter estimates.

**Answer:**

```{r}
#| label: ex1

# add code here

```

## Exercise 2

Compute a 95% confidence interval for the regression slope. Provide an interpretation for this confidence interval.

**Answer:**

```{r}
#| label: ex2

# add code here

```


## Exercise 3

In real estate, the price per square foot is an indicator of how expensive it is to buy living space in that area, with a higher price per square foot generally signifying a more expensive city due to factors like high demand for limited land, desirable location, and often, a high cost of living.

Let's assume that a city is considered to have a high living cost if the price per square foot is higher than 150. Using the slope as an estimate for price per square foot, estimate the probability that the Duke Forest area has a price per square foot greater than 150, $P(\beta_1 > 150)$. Interpret the results in plain English. 

**Answer:**

```{r}
#| label: ex3

# add code here
