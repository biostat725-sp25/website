Complete all the preparation work before class.\n\n2.  Ask questions in class, office hours, and on Ed Discussion.\n\n3.  Do the homework; get started on homework early when possible.\n\n4.  Don't procrastinate and don't let a week pass by with lingering questions.\n\n5.  Stay up-to-date on announcements on Ed Discussion and sent via email.\n\n# Probability\n\nThis is foundational material that you should have already learned in a previous course. I'm reviewing important concepts that are needed for Bayesian inference.\n\n## Review of probability\n\n-   The goal of Bayesian statistics is to compute the posterior distribution (i.e., the uncertainty distribution of the parameters, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, after observing the data, $\\mathbf{Y}$)\n\n-   This is the conditional distribution of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ given $\\mathbf{Y}$\n\n-   Therefore, we need to review the probability concepts that lead to the conditional distribution of one variable conditioned on another\n\n    1.  Probability mass (pmf) and density (pdf) functions\n\n    2.  Joint distributions\n\n    3.  Marginal and conditional distributions\n\n## Random variables\n\n-   $X$ (capital) is a random variable\n\n-   We want to compute the probability that $X$ takes on a specific value $x$ (lowercase)\n\n    -   This is denoted $P(X = x)$\n\n-   We also might want to compute the probability of $X$ being in a set $\\mathcal A$\n\n    -   This is denoted $P(X \\in \\mathcal A)$\n\n-   The set of possible values that $X$ can take on is called its support, $\\mathcal S$\n\n## Random variables - example\n\n-   Example 1: $X$ is the roll of a die\n\n    -   The support is $\\mathcal S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n    -   $P(X = 1) = 1/6$\n\n-   Example 2: $X$ is a newborn babyâ€™s weight\n\n    -   The support is $\\mathcal S = (0, \\infty)$\n    -   $P(X \\in [0, \\infty]) = 1$\n\n<!-- ## Axioms of probability -->\n\n<!-- For two events $A$ and $B$, -->\n\n<!-- A1. Probabilities are between 0 and 1, importantly $P(A^c | A) = 0$ and $P(A | A) = 1$. -->\n\n<!-- A2. If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then $P(A\\text{ or }B) = P(A) + P(B)$. -->\n\n<!-- A3. The joint probability of two events may be broken down stepwise: $P(A,B) = P(A | B)P(B)$. -->\n\n<!-- ## Consequences of probability axioms -->\n\n<!-- -   For any partition $\\{H_i\\}_{i = 1}^n$, $\\sum_{i=1}^n P(H_i) = 1$ (rule of total probability) -->\n\n<!--     -   Note: simplest partition $P(A) + P(A^c) = 1$ -->\n\n<!-- -   $P(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^n P(A, H_i)$ (rule of marginal probability) -->\n\n<!--     -   Note: A3 implies that equivalently, $P(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^n P(A | H_i) P(H_i)$ -->\n\n<!-- -   $P(A | B) = P(A,B) / P(B)$ when $P(B) \\neq 0$ -->\n\n<!--     -   Note: these statements can also be made where each term is additionally conditioned on another event $C$ -->\n\n## What is probability?\n\nObjective (associated with frequentist)\n\n-   $P(X = x)$ as a purely mathematical statement\n-   If we repeatedly sampled $X$, the the proportion of draws equal to $x$ converges to $P(X = x)$\n\nSubjective (associated with Bayesian)\n\n-   $P(X = x)$ represents an individualâ€™s degree of belief\n-   Often quantified as the amount an individual would be willing to wager that $X$ will be $x$\n\nA Bayesian analysis makes use of both of these concepts\n\n## What is uncertainty?\n\nAleatoric uncertainty (likelihood)\n\n-   Uncontrollable randomness in the experiment\n\n-   For example, the results of a fair coin flip can never be predicted with certainty\n\nEpistemic uncertainty (prior/posterior)\n\n-   Uncertainty about a quantity that could theoretically be known\n\n-   For example, if we flipped a coin infinitely-many times we could know the true probability of a head\n\nA Bayesian analysis makes use of both of these concepts\n\n<!-- ## Probability versus statistics -->\n\n<!-- Probability is the forward problem -->\n\n<!-- -   We assume we know how the data are being generated and compute the probability of events -->\n\n<!-- -   For example, what is the probability of flipping 5 straight heads if the coin is fair? -->\n\n<!-- Statistics is the inverse problem -->\n\n<!-- -   We use data to learn about the data-generating mechanism -->\n\n<!-- -   For example, if we flipped five straight head, can we conclude the coin is biased? -->\n\n<!-- Any statistical analysis obviously relies on probability -->\n\n## Univariate distributions\n\n-   We often distinguish between discrete and continuous random variables\n\n-   The random variable $X$ is **discrete** if its support $\\mathcal S$ is countable\n\n-   Examples:\n\n$X \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$ is the number of successes in 3 trials\\\n\n$X \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$ is the number of patients with COVID in Durham County\n\n## Univariate distributions\n\n-   We often distinguish between discrete and continuous random variables\n\n-   The random variable $X$ is **continuous** if its support $\\mathcal S$ is uncountable\n\n-   Examples with $\\mathcal S = (0, \\infty)$:\n\n$X > 0$ is systolic blood pressure\\\n\n$X > 0$ is a patient's BMI\n\n## Discrete univariate distributions\n\n-   If $X$ is discrete we describe its distribution with its **probability mass function (pmf)**\n\n-   The pmf is $f(x) = P(X = x)$\n\n-   The domain of $X$ is the set of $x$ with $f(x) > 0$\n\n-   We must have $f(x) \\geq 0$ and $\\sum_x f(x) = 1$\n\n-   The mean is $\\mathbb E[X] = \\sum_x x f(x)$\n\n-   The variance is $\\mathbb V(X) = \\sum_x(x âˆ’ \\mathbb E[X])^2f(x)$\n\n-   The last three sums are over $X$â€™s domain\n\n## Parametric families of distributions\n\n-   A statistical analysis typically proceeds by selecting a pmf that seems to match the distribution of a sample\n\n-   We rarely know the pmf exactly, but we assume it is from a parametric family of distributions\n\n-   For example, Binomial(10, 0.5) and Binomial(4, 0.1) are different but both from the binomial family\n\n-   A family of distributions have the same equation for the pmf but differ by some unknown parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$\n\n-   We must estimate these parameters\n\n## Continuous univariate distributions\n\n-   If $X$ is continuous we describe its distribution with the **probability density function (pdf)** $f(x) \\geq 0$\n\n-   Since there are uncountably many possible values, $P(X = x) = 0$ for all $x$,\n\n-   Probabilities are computed as areas under the pdf curve $$P(a < X < b) = \\int_a^b f(x)dx$$\n\n-   Therefore, to be valid $f(x)$ must satisfy $f(x) \\geq 0$ and $$P(âˆ’\\infty < X < \\infty) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)dx = 1$$\n\n## Continuous univariate distributions\n\n-   The domain is the set of $x$ values with $f(x) > 0$\n\n-   The mean and the variance are defined similarly to the discrete case but with the sums replaced by integrals\n\n-   The mean is $\\mathbb E[X] = \\int x f(x)dx$\n\n-   The variance is $\\mathbb V(X) = \\int (x âˆ’ \\mathbb E[X])^2 f(x)dx$\n\n## Joint distributions\n\n-   $\\mathbf{X} = (X_1, \\ldots, X_p)$ is a random vector (vectors and matrices should be in bold).\n\n-   For notational convenience, letâ€™s consider only $p = 2$ random variables $X$ and $Y$.\n\n-   $(X, Y)$ is discrete if it can take on a countable number of values, such as\\\n    $X$ = number of hearts and $Y$ = number of face cards.\n\n-   $(X, Y)$ is continuous if it can take on an uncountable number of values, such as\\\n    $X$ = birthweight and $Y$ = gestational age.\n\n## Discrete random variables\n\n-   The **joint pmf** is $f(x, y) = P(X = x, Y = y)$\n\n    -   $\\sum_x \\sum_y f(x, y) = 1$\n\n-   The **marginal pmf** for $X$ is $f_X(x) = P(X = x) = \\sum_y f(x, y)$\n\n-   The **marginal pmf** for $Y$ is $f_Y(y) = P(Y = y) = \\sum_x\n    f(x, y)$\n\n-   The marginal distribution is the same as univariate distribution as if we ignored the other variable\n\n## Discrete random variables\n\n-   The **conditional pmf** of $Y$ given $X$ is $f(y|x) = P(Y = y|X = x) = \\frac{P(X = x, Y = y)}{P(X = x)} = \\frac{f(x, y)}{f_X (x)}.$\n\n-   $X$ and $Y$ are **independent** if $f(x, y) = f_X(x)f_Y(y)$ for all $x$ and $y$\n\n    -   Variables are dependent if they are not independent\n\n-   Equivalently, $X$ and $Y$ are independent if $f(x|y) = f_X(x)$ for all $x$ and $y$\n\n## Discrete random variables\n\n-   Notation: $X_1, \\dots, X_n \\overset{\\mathrm{iid}}{\\sim} f(x)$ means that $X_1, \\ldots, X_n$ are independent and identically distributed\n\n-   This implies the **joint pmf** is $$P(X_1 = x_1, \\ldots, X_n = x_n) = \\prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i)$$\n\n-   The same notation and definitions of independence apply to continuous random variables\n\n-   In this class, assume independence unless otherwise noted\n\n## Continuous random variables\n\n-   Manipulating joint pdfs is similar to joint pmfs but sums are replaced by integrals\n\n-   The **joint pdf** is denoted $f(x, y)$\n\n-   Probabilities are computed as volume under the pdf: $$P((X, Y) âˆˆ A) = \\int_A f(x, y)dxdy$$ where $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$\n\n## Continuous random variables\n\n-   The **marginal pdf** of $X$ is $f_X(x) = \\int f(x, y)dy$\n\n-   $f_X$ is the univariate pdf for $X$ as if we never considered $Y$\n\n-   The **conditional pdf** of $Y$ given $X$ is $$f(y|x) = \\frac{f(x, y)}{f_X (x)}$$\n\n-   Proper: $\\int f(y|x)dy = \\int \\frac{f(x,y)}{f_X(x)}dy = \\int \\frac{f(x,y)dy}{f_X(x)} = 1$\n\n## Defining joint distributions conditionally\n\n-   Specifying joint distributions is hard\n\n-   Every joint distribution can be written $f(x, y) = f(y|x)f(x)$\n\n-   Therefore, any joint distribution can be defined by\n\n    1.  $X$â€™s marginal distribution\n\n    2.  The conditional distribution of $Y|X$\n\n-   The joint problem reduces to two univariate problems\n\n-   This idea forms the basis of hierarchical modeling\n\n<!-- ## Review: Set theory {.small} -->\n\n<!-- ::: callout-note -->\n\n<!-- ## Definition -->\n\n<!-- **set**: a collection of elements, denoted by {} -->\n\n<!-- Examples -->\n\n<!-- -   $\\phi$ = {} \"the empty set\" -->\n\n<!-- -   $A$ = {1, 2, 3} -->\n\n<!-- -   $B$ = {taken BIOSTAT 724, has not taken BIOSTAT 724} -->\n\n<!-- -   $C$ = {{1,2,3}, {4, 5}} -->\n\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<!-- ::: callout-note -->\n\n<!-- ## Definition -->\n\n<!-- **subset**: denoted by $\\subset$, $A \\subset B$ iff -->\n\n<!-- $a \\in A \\implies a \\in B$ -->\n\n<!-- Examples -->\n\n<!-- Using the previously examples of $A$, $B$ and $C$ above, -->\n\n<!-- -   $A \\subset C$ -->\n\n<!-- -   $A \\not\\subset B$ -->\n\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<!-- Recall: $\\cup$ means \"union\", \"or\"; $\\cap$ means \"intersection\", \"and\" -->\n\n<!-- ## Review: Set theory {.small} -->\n\n<!-- ::: callout-note -->\n\n<!-- ## Definition -->\n\n<!-- **partition**: {$H_1, H_2, ...
