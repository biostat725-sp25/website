There are no markers in today's lab, but you should use a similar workflow as Lab 04.\n\n    -   Every team member should still be engaged in discussion for all questions, even if it's not your turn type.\n\n-   Don't forget to **pull** to get your teammates' updates before making changes to the `.qmd` file.\n\n    ::: callout-important\n    **Only one submission per team on Gradescope. Carefully read the submission instructions at the end of the lab instructions.**\n    :::\n\n## Tips for working on a team {.midi}\n\n-   Do not pressure each other to finish early; use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.\n\n-   The labs are structured to help you learn the steps of a data analysis. Do not split up the lab among the team members; work on it together in its entirety.\n\n-   Everyone has something to contribute! Use the lab groups as an opportunity to share ideas and learn from each other.\n\n## STA 210 Mid Semester Survey\n\nPlease take a few minutes to complete the STA 210 Mid Semester Survey.\\\n\\\n[Click here](https://duke.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_86XWKdUFjvStYmW) to access the survey.\n\n## Resources for Lab 04 {.midi}\n\n-   Lecture notes:\n\n    -   [Feature engineering](https://sta210-fa23.netlify.app/slides/11-feature-engineering.html#/title-slide)\n    -   [Feature engineering: Model workflow](https://sta210-fa23.netlify.app/slides/12-feature-engineering-pt2.html#/title-slide)\n\n-   [Recipes package function reference](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/reference/index.html)\n\n-   Tidy Modeling in R - [Chapter 8: Feature engineering with recipes](https://www.tmwr.org/recipes.html)\n",
