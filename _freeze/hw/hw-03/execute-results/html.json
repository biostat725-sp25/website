The is a simulated study that is meant to be a large study of lung cancer outcomes across multiple doctors and sites. Assume that the variables were collected prior to a lung cancer surgery. Our primary outcome in this homework is the hospital length of stay (`LengthofStay`) following the surgery. We will use the following variables from the dataset:\n\n-   `Age`: continuous, age in years.\n\n-   `Married`: binary, married/living with partner of single.\n\n-   `FamilyHx`: binary (yes/no), does the patient have a family history (Hx) of cancer?\n\n-   `SmokingHx`: categorical with three levels, current smoker, former smoker, never smoked.\n\n-   `Sex`: binary (female/male).\n\n-   `CancerStage`: categorical with four levels, stages 1-4.\n\n-   `LengthofStay`: count number of days patients stayed in the hospital after surgery.\n\n-   `WBC`: continuous, white blood count.\n\n-   `RBC`: continuous, red blood count.\n\n-   `BMI`: body mass index given by the formula ($kg/m^2$).\n\n-   `IL6`: continuous, interleukin 6, a proinflammatory cytokine commonly examined as an indicator of inflammation, cannot be lower than zero.\n\n-   `CRP`: continuous, C-reactive protein, a protein in the blood also used as an indicator of inflammation.\n\nFor our homework we will use the `hdp` dataset from the `MLMusingR` R package. The dataset can be loaded as follows. Note that we will work with a subsample of 1,000 patients.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(MLMusingR)\nset.seed(54)\nhdp <- hdp[sample(1:nrow(hdp), size = 1000, replace = TRUE), ]\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Exercises 1-6\n\nResearchers are interested in the association between the predictors: sex, marital status, and smoking history, and the outcome: BMI. They start by visualizing the distribution of BMI and notice that it is a bit right-skewed; and thus they are worried about performing linear regression. Instead they would like to perform median regression.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-nrow=\"1\" layout-ncol=\"1\" layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hw-03_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSetup a multivariable median regression model to estimate the association between the predictors: sex, marital status, and smoking history, and the outcome: BMI. Define the random variable $Y_i$ as the BMI in $kg/m^2$ for patient $i$ and the median quantile of $Y_i$ given predictors $\\mathbf{x}_i$ as $q({Y_i|\\mathbf{x}_i})$. We will model the median quantile as a linear function of the predictors, $$q({Y_i|\\mathbf{x}_i}) = \\alpha + \\mathbf{x}_i\\boldsymbol{\\beta},$$ where $\\mathbf{x}_i = (Male_i, Married_i, Current\\_Smoker_i, Former\\_Smoker_i).$ Each of these predictors is just a binary variable.\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nFormulate this regression problem within the framework of a Bayesian model (hint: Laplace distribution!). Fit this regression using Stan to estimate $(\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{\\beta})$ and any other parameters that arise in the model. For all model parameters, choose weakly-informative priors. Evaluate model convergence.\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nPerform a posterior predictive check using the median as a test statistic. Be sure to present a posterior predictive p-value and use it to describe the model fit.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nPerform a posterior predictive check for the 2.5th and 97.5th quantiles. Comment on the difference between the result from **Exercise 2**.\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nPresent posterior summaries for all population parameters. For all predictors with a significant association (i.e., 95% credible interval does not include zero), provide an interpretation within the context of the problem.\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nFit the same model as in **Exercise 1** using linear regression. Compare the posterior mean estimates of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ between the two models. Do they correspond?\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nPerform a model comparison between the models in **Exercise 1** and **Exercise 5**. Which model is preferred? Provide intuition for why one model may be preferred over the other.\n\n# Exercises 7-11\n\nDefine a binary outcome variable $Y_i = 1(LengthofStay_i > 5)$ for $i = 1,\\ldots,n$. We are interested in performing logistic regression such that $Y_i \\stackrel{ind}{\\sim}\\text{Bernoulli}(\\pi_i)$, where\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{logit} (\\pi_i) &= \\alpha + \\beta_1 Age_i + \\beta_2 Married_i + \\beta_3 Yes\\_Family\\_History_i\\\\\n&\\hspace{1cm}+ \\beta_4 Current\\_Smoker_i + \\beta_5 Former\\_Smoker_i + \\beta_6 Male_i\\\\\n&\\hspace{1cm}+ \\beta_7 Cancer\\_Stage2_i + \\beta_8 Cancer\\_Stage3_i + \\beta_9 Cancer\\_Stage4_i\\\\\n&\\hspace{1cm}+ \\gamma_1 WBC_i + \\gamma_2 RBC_i + \\gamma_3 BMI_i + \\gamma_4 IL6_i + \\gamma_5 CRP_i\\\\\n&= \\alpha + \\mathbf{x}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\mathbf{z}_i \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe population parameters are $(\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{\\beta},\\boldsymbol{\\gamma})$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (\\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_9)$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma} = (\\gamma_1,\\ldots,\\gamma_5)$. Use the following priors for the centered intercept and regression parameters, $\\alpha \\sim N(0, 3^2)$ and $\\beta_j \\sim N(0, 3^2)$ for $j = 1,\\ldots,p$ ($p=9$). The researchers would like to place a horseshoe prior on each $\\gamma_l$, $l=1,\\ldots,q$ ($q = 5$). \n\nThe horseshoe prior for $\\gamma_l$ is given by, \\begin{align*}\n\\gamma_l | \\lambda_l, \\tau, c &\\sim N\\left(0, \\tau^2 \\lambda_l^2\\right),\\\\\n\\lambda_l &\\sim \\mathcal C^+(0,1),\\\\\n\\tau &\\sim \\mathcal C^+(0,\\tau_0^2).\n\\end{align*}\n\nBe sure to standardize these predictors prior to assigning a horseshoe prior.\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nBefore fitting the horseshoe regression, a realistic value of $\\tau_0$ must be determined. Compute a realistic value for $\\tau_0$ based on the effective number of non-zero coefficients. Researchers have a prior belief that the number of non-zero coefficients will be equal to 1 (i.e., $q_0 = 1$). When computing $\\tau_0$ be sure to provide a visual justification by plotting the effective number of non-zero coefficients for your choice of $\\tau_0$.\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nFit the logistic regression model using the horseshoe prior above. Present model convergence diagnostics and make a statement about whether the MCMC sampler has converged.\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nVisualize the posterior distributions for the population parameters $(\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})$. $\\alpha$ is the intercept on the scale of the original data. Make a statement about the impact of the horseshoe prior on the posterior shape for $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}$.\n\n## Exercise 10\n\nPresent posterior summaries for $(\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})$. Choose one predictor that is significant and provide an interpretation of the posterior mean.\n\n## Exercise 11\n\nVisualize the posterior distribution of $\\pi_2$ and $\\pi_4$, which are the probability of having a length of stay greater than 5 days for observation $Y_2$ and $Y_4$, respectively (i.e., the second and fourth rows of the `hdp` dataset). Compute $P(\\pi_4 > \\pi_2 | \\mathbf{Y})$ and make a statement about which patient is more likely to have a longer length of stay.\n\n<!-- # Exercises 9-10 -->\n\n<!-- ## Exercise 9 -->\n\n<!-- Researchers are interested in the association between cancer stage and number of days in the hospital post surgery.

Note that we removed observations with lengths of stay equal to 2 and 9 due to sample size issues. -->\n\n<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->\n\n<!-- hdp <- hdp[hdp$LengthofStay > 2 & hdp$LengthofStay < 9, ] -->\n\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n<!-- We would like to fit a proportional odds logistic regression model, $$\\log \\frac{P(Y_i\\leq k)}{P(Y_i > k)} = \\text{logit}P(Y_i\\leq k) = \\alpha_k - \\mathbf{x}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\quad k = 1,\\ldots, K-1$$ where $\\mathbf{x}_i = (Cancer\\_Stage2_i, Cancer\\_Stage3_i, Cancer\\_Stage4_i)$.
