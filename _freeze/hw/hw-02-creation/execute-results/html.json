Click on the repo with the prefix **hw-02**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the homework.\n\n-   Clone the repo and start a new project in RStudio. See the [AE 01 instructions](https://biostat725-sp25.netlify.app/ae/ae-01-mcmc#clone-the-repo-start-new-rstudio-project) for details on cloning a repo and starting a new project in R.\n\n# Packages\n\nThe following packages are used in this assignment:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rstan)\nlibrary(bayesplot)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(loo)\n\n# load other packages as needed\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nIt is estimated that only 3.0% of Americans engage in a fully healthy lifestyle, which entails refraining from smoking, eating five or more fruits and vegetables daily, maintaining a healthy weight, and participating in regular exercise (a component of physical activity). Lack of physical activity is a leading risk factor for chronic disease and having access to recreational facilities has been associated with an individual’s level of physical activity and exercise. Researchers were interested in analyzing the association between access to recreational facilities and exercise, controlling for crime. It has been suggested that reductions of violence/crime and increased perceptions of neighborhood safety may contribute to higher population levels of physical activity.\n\nResearchers performed a cross-sectional observational study of Cook County, Chicago, randomly recruiting 87 pregnant women and obtained an estimate of weekly exercise as measured by metabolic equivalent (MET) minutes per week. Measures of neighborhood recreational facilities and crime were obtained based on geographical kernel estimates. The data they collected can be found in the dataset, *exercise.csv*, which is available in the homework repo.\n\nThe following variables are in the dataset:\n\n-   `exercise`: exercise measured in metabolic equivalent (MET) minutes per week.\n\n-   `recreation`: number of recreational facilities within a one-mile radius of a participant's home.\n\n-   `crime`: total yearly average of all crimes in a one-mile buffer surrounding an individual’s residence per 1,000 persons.\n\n-   `age`: age in years.\n\n-   `married`: marriage status (1 = married; 0 = single)\n\n-   `race`: race (0 = White ; 1 = African-American/black, 2 = Asian)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nSetup a multivariable linear regression to estimate the association between access to recreational facilities and exercise, making sure to allow for this relationship to change based on crime. Be sure to control for the following confounders: age, marital status, and race. Assume that $exercise_i \\stackrel{ind}{\\sim} N(\\mu_i, \\sigma^2)$ for $i = 1,\\ldots,n$ where \\begin{align*}\n\\mu_i &= \\alpha + recreation_i \\beta_1 + crime_i \\beta_2+(recreation_i \\times crime_i) \\beta_3\\\\\n&\\quad+ age_i \\beta_4 + black_i \\beta_5 + asian_i \\beta_6 + married_i \\beta_7\\\\\n&= \\alpha + \\mathbf{x}_i\\boldsymbol{\\beta}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nFit this regression using a Bayesian framework in Stan to estimate $(\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{\\beta},\\sigma)$. For all model parameters, choose weakly-informative priors. For example, $\\alpha \\sim N(0,100)$, $\\beta_j \\sim N(0,100)$ for $j=1,\\ldots,p$, and $\\sigma \\sim \\text{Half-Normal}(0,100)$.\n\nEvaluate model convergence and present posterior predictive checks. Provide an argument for whether the model fits the data well.\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nRefit the model in **Exercise 1**, this time using a centered outcome variable, $Y_i = exercise_i - \\overline{exercise}$, where $\\overline{exercise} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n exercise_i$. Once again, evaluate model convergence and present posterior predictive checks. Provide an argument for whether the model fits the data well and make a comparison to the model from **Exercise 1**. Make an argument for why this model may have improved model fit.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nFor the model from **Exercise 2**, present the posterior means, standard deviations, and 95% credible intervals for all model parameters. What is interpretation of the slope main effect corresponding to `recreation` in your model? Is this interpretation appropriate?\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nWhat is the association between access to recreational facilities and exercise, for a pregnant women living in an area with 5 annual crimes/1,000 people? What about for 15 annual crimes/1,000 people? Provide posterior mean and standard deviations for both quantities.\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nInterpret the posterior mean and standard deviations from **Exercise 4** and compare and contrast them. What do these posterior slopes say about the impact of crime on the relationship between access to recreational facilities and exercise.\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nResearchers are interested in the level of crime where the association between recreational facilities and exercise disappears. Present the posterior median and interquartile range (i.e., 25% and 75% percentiles) for this quantity.\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nCompute the posterior predictive distribution for a patient with 10 recreational facilities within a one-mile radius, 5 crimes within a one-mile buffer per 1,000 people, is 40 years old, married, and white race. Report the posterior mean and 95% credible intervals.\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nResearchers are interested in comparing their original model (i.e., the one from **Exercise 2**) with a model that does not contain an interaction term between recreational facility access and crime. Fit the model without the interaction term and perform a model comparison between the two models using an information criteria. Which model would you suggest as more scientifically plausible?\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nPerform a sensitivity analysis to the choice of prior for $(\\alpha,\\boldsymbol{\\beta},\\sigma)$. Make sure to change the family of priors for each parameter. So, if you chose a Gaussian prior for $\\alpha$ originally, choose another distribution, like a student-t. Are your results robust to the choice of prior?\n\n::: render-commit-push\nYou’re done and ready to submit your work! render, commit, and push all remaining changes.
