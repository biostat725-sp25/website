Lack of physical activity is a leading risk factor for chronic disease and having access to recreational facilities has been associated with an individual’s level of physical activity and exercise. Researchers were interested in analyzing the association between access to recreational facilities and exercise, controlling for crime. It has been suggested that reductions of violence/crime and increased perceptions of neighborhood safety may contribute to higher population levels of physical activity. \n\nResearchers performed a cross-sectional observational study of Cook County, Chicago, randomly recruiting 87 pregnant women and obtained an estimate of weekly exercise as measured by metabolic equivalent (MET) minutes per week. Measures of neighborhood recreational facilities and crime were obtained based on geographical kernel estimates. The data they collected can be found in the dataset, *exercise.csv*, which is available in the homework repo.\n\nThe following variables are in the dataset:\n\n- `exercise`: exercise measured in metabolic equivalent (MET) minutes per week.\n\n- `recreation`: number of recreational facilities within a one-mile radius of a participant's home.\n\n- `crime`: total yearly average of all crimes in a one-mile buffer surrounding an individual’s residence per 1,000 persons. \n\n- `age`: age in years.\n\n- `married`: marriage status (1 = married; 0 = single)\n\n- `race`: race (0 = White ; 1 = African-American/black, 2 = Asian)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nSetup a multivariable regression to estimate the association between access to recreational facilities and exercise, making sure to allow for this relationship to change based on crime. Be sure to control for the following confounders: age, marital status, and race. Assume that $exercise_i \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} N(\\mu_i, \\sigma^2)$ for $i = 1,\\ldots,n$ where\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mu_i &= \\alpha + recreation_i \\beta_1 + crime_i \\beta_2+(recreation_i \\times crime_i) \\beta_3\\\\\n&+ age_i \\beta_4 + black_i \\beta_5 + asian_i \\beta_6 + married_i \\beta_7.\n\\end{align*}\n\n \nPresent the results from your regression.\n\n\n- ***Answer:*** We will perform a multivariable linear regression where the dependent variable is exercise, and the predictors are: recreation, crime, age, married, and race. Plus, to allow for the association between recreation and exercise to vary across crime, we include an interaction between crime and recreation. Note that we must be sure race is treated as a dummy variable, so we use the $\\{as.factor}$ function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexercise$race <- as.factor(exercise$race)\nreg <- lm(exercise ~ recreation + crime + recreation * crime \n          + age + race + married, data = exercise)\nsummary(reg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = exercise ~ recreation + crime + recreation * crime + \n    age + race + married, data = exercise)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-6.8386 -1.4686  0.2276  1.6052  4.1927 \n\nCoefficients:\n                  Estimate Std.

We can create a figure to assess the last three assumptions.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hw-01-creation_files/figure-html/ass-1.png){fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe figure on the left is of the fitted values versus the residuals. From this figure we see that there is no evidence of heteroskedasticity, so our variance assumption is OK. This figure also indicates that linearity is satisfied, as there is no pattern in the residuals across the fitted values. Then, in the figure on the right we see that the distribution of the residuals is normally distributed, so our distributional assumptions is OK. Finally, independence is satisfied, because we are randomly sampling pregnant women from across Cook County, Chicago. Linearity could have also been assessed by looking at all pairwise scatterplots as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hw-01-creation_files/figure-html/linear-1.png){fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOur outcome variable, exercise appears to be linearly related to all of our continous predictors.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nWhat is interpretation of the slope main effect corresponding to `recreation` in your model at the 0.05 significance level? Is this interpretation appropriate?\n\n- ***Answer:*** Assuming a crime level of zero, we can interpret the slope corresponding to recreation, assuming all other variables are fixed. The interpretation is that for a one unit increase in recreation (i.e., number of recreational centers within a one-mile radius), exercise MET per week will increase by 2.97 MET. The p-value for this effect is significant at the 0.05 level, therefore we can conclude that for those people who live in areas of zero crime, there is an association between access to recreational facilities and exercise. This interpretation is likely not appropriate, because there are no areas with zero crime.\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nWhat is the association between access to recreational facilities and exercise, for a pregnant women living in an area with 5 annual crimes/1,000 people? What about for 15 annual crimes/1,000 people?\n\n- ***Answer:*** The association between access to recreational facilities and exercise is a function of crime. In particular, this effect is given by the following: $\\beta_{Rec} + \\beta_{Rec \\times Crime} \\times \\texttt{crime}_i = 2.969 - 0.298 \\times  \\texttt{crime}_i$. Plugging in for a crime value of 5, we get: 1.479. For a crime value of 15, we get a slope of -1.501.\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nInterpret the slopes from (d) and compare and contrast them. What do these slopes say about the impact of crime on the relationship between access to recreational facilities and exercise.\n\n- ***Answer:*** The interpretation of the slopes are as follows: At an annual level of crime of 5/1,000 people and keeping all of the variables constant, the association between recreational facilities and exercise has a slope of 1.479. This indicates that a one-unit increase in recreational facilities will result in a 1.5 MET increase in exercise. When crime increases to an annual level of 15/1,000 people, this slope becomes negative, -1.5. This indicates that crime is an effect modifier for the association of interest. In particular, for low levels of crime, the association is positive, however for larger values of crime the slope becomes negative. \n\n## Exercise 6\n\nAt what level of crime does the association between recreational facilities and exercise disappear?\n\n- ***Answer:*** We know that the effect of recreational facilities on exercies is a function of crime, because of the interaction term. In particular, this effect is given by the followiing: $\\beta_{Rec} + \\beta_{Rec \\times Crime} \\times \\texttt{crime}_i = 2.969 - 0.298 \\times  \\texttt{crime}_i$. Therefore, we would like to set this effect to zero and solve for $\\texttt{crime}_i$. Doing this, we find that $\\texttt{crime}_i = 2.969 / 0.298 = 9.963.$\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nTo confirm your conclusions from (f), create a visualization that demontrates the relationship between recreation and exercise, across crime levels below and above the value you found in (f). An effective figure provides a title, axis labels, and a legible legend.\n\n- ***Answer:*** We will create a scatterplot that plots recreation vs. exercise. To visualize the association across crime, we will create a new variable that is an indicator of a crime value below and above the value we found in (f), 9.963. Then, we will color code the points based on this variable. This visualization confirms our conclusions about the association between recreation and exercise, as the slope is positive for low crime and negative for high crime.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexercise %>% \n  mutate(crime2 = 1 * (crime >= 9.963)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = recreation, y = exercise, col = as.factor(crime2))) + \n  geom_point() + \n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Crime >= 9.963\") +\n  labs(title = \"Scatter plot of recreational facilities vs. exercise (MET)\") + \n  ylab(\"Exercises (MET/week)\") + \n  xlab(\"Number of recreational facilities within 1-mile radius\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hw-01-creation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nNow, assume the researchers are interested in understanding the impact of marital status on the relationship between access to recreational facililities and exercise. Setup a multivariable regression to estimate this association. There is no need to include other confounders. Does the association of interest (i.e., the relationship between access to recreational facilities and exercise) change across marital status? For a married pregnant women, what is the estimated slope of recreational facilities on exercise? What about for single pregnant women?\n\n- ***Answer:*** The regression is as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreg2 <- lm(exercise ~ recreation * married, data = exercise)\nsummary(reg2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = exercise ~ recreation * married, data = exercise)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-154.734  -15.102    4.876   21.932  129.803 \n\nCoefficients:\n                   Estimate Std.

The hypotheses that this corresponds to is $H_0:\\beta_3 = 0, H_1:\\beta_3 \\neq 0$ at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ level. Therefore, the association of interest does change across marital status. In particular, for a married pregnant woman the association (or slope) is $\\beta_1 + \\beta_3 = 1.504 - 2.857 = -1.353$, and for single pregnant women, $\\beta_1 = 1.504$. \n\n::: render-commit-push\nYou’re done and ready to submit your work! render, commit, and push all remaining changes.
