This dataset has been of interest to medical researchers who are studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. A random sample of 1,000 cases from the dataset released in 2014 can be found in the `births14` data set in the **openintro** R package.\n\nWe will focus on the following variables:\n\n-   `visits`: Number of hospital visits during pregnancy\n\n-   `weight`: Weight of the baby at birth in pounds\n\n-   `habit`: Status of the mother as a `nonsmoker` or a `smoker`\n\nFor this homework, work with the complete case dataset.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbirths14 <- births14[complete.cases(births14), ]\nglimpse(births14)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 794\nColumns: 13\n$ fage           <int> 34, 36, 37, 32, 32, 37, 29, 30, 29, 30, 34, 28, 32, 24,…\n$ mage           <dbl> 34, 31, 36, 31, 26, 36, 24, 32, 26, 34, 27, 22, 25, 20,…\n$ mature         <chr> \"younger mom\", \"younger mom\", \"mature mom\", \"younger mo…\n$ weeks          <dbl> 37, 41, 37, 36, 39, 36, 40, 39, 39, 42, 40, 40, 34, 37,…\n$ premie         <chr> \"full term\", \"full term\", \"full term\", \"premie\", \"full …\n$ visits         <dbl> 14, 12, 10, 12, 14, 10, 13, 15, 11, 14, 16, 20, 20, 10,…\n$ gained         <dbl> 28, 41, 28, 48, 45, 20, 65, 25, 22, 40, 30, 31, 25, 70,…\n$ weight         <dbl> 6.96, 8.86, 7.51, 6.75, 6.69, 6.13, 6.74, 8.94, 9.12, 8…\n$ lowbirthweight <chr> \"not low\", \"not low\", \"not low\", \"not low\", \"not low\", …\n$ sex            <chr> \"male\", \"female\", \"female\", \"female\", \"female\", \"female…\n$ habit          <chr> \"nonsmoker\", \"nonsmoker\", \"nonsmoker\", \"nonsmoker\", \"no…\n$ marital        <chr> \"married\", \"married\", \"married\", \"married\", \"married\", …\n$ whitemom       <chr> \"white\", \"white\", \"not white\", \"white\", \"white\", \"white…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercises 1-7\n\nDefine a random variable $Y_i$ that represents the number of hospital visits during pregnancy for each woman $i$, for $i = 1,\\ldots,n$. Assume that this random variable follows a Poisson distribution with rate $\\lambda$, such that $Y_i \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$. For a Poisson distribution, the mean and variance are equal to $\\lambda$. We are interested in performing statistical inference on $\\lambda$ using a Bayesian approach. A frequently used prior for $\\lambda$ is $\\text{Gamma}(\\text{shape = }a, \\text{rate = }b)$, where $\\mathbb{E}[\\lambda] = a/b$ and $\\mathbb{V}(\\lambda) = a/b^2$.\n\n### Exercise 1\n\nThe researchers have prior knowledge that leads them to believe that $\\lambda$ should have mean 8 and variance 4. What values of $a$ and $b$ should they specify?\n\n### Exercise 2\n\nUsing the prior specified in **Exercise 1**, compute the probability that $\\lambda$ is greater than 11? For this computation compute the exact probability using the `pgamma` function in R. This is equivalent to computing $P(\\lambda > 11)$.\n\n### Exercise 3 \n\nCompute the same probability as in **Exercise 2**, this time using Monte Carlo sampling. Report your Monte Carlo standard error and make sure it is less than 0.01.\n\n### Exercise 4\n\nSuppose the researchers are interested in the quantity, $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\lambda}$. Compute the probability that $\\alpha$ is greater than 2.5. Use the same number of Monte Carlo samples as in **Exercise 3** and describe why Monte Carlo sampling makes this computation much more efficient than computing the exact probability. \n\n### Exercise 5\n\nUsing the prior specified in **Exercise 1**, compute the posterior distribution for $\\lambda$, $f(\\lambda | \\mathbf{Y})$, where $\\mathbf{Y}_i = (Y_1,\\ldots,Y_n).$ Recall that the Gamma prior for $\\lambda$ is a conjugate prior, so that the posterior is given by: $f(\\lambda|\\mathbf{Y}) \\sim Gamma(a + \\sum_{i=1}^nY_i,b+n)$. Visualize the posterior distribution and report the posterior mean and a 95% credible interval. Provide an interpretation of the posterior summaries within the context of the US births data.\n\n### Exercise 6\n\nWhat is the posterior probability that $\\lambda$ is greater than 11? This is equivalent to computing $P(\\lambda > 11 | \\mathbf{Y})$. Again, use Monte Carlo sampling. Provide an interpretation for this probability in the context of hospital visits.\n\n### Exercise 7\n\nCreate a figure that includes both the prior and posterior distributions for $\\lambda$. Also, include a figure of the observed data. Use these figures to make a comparison of the prior and posterior probabilities found in **Exercise 3** and **Exercise 6**, respectively. Describe any changes in these two probabilities and how they relate to the observed data.\n\n## Exercise 8-10\n\nDefine a random variable $weight_i$ that represents the weight of the baby at birth in ounces for pregnancy $i$. We are interested in learning the association between birth weight and the smoking habit, $habit_i$, of the mother. Fit the following Bayesian linear regression model using Gibbs sampling,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nweight_i &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times 1(habit_i = \\text{smoker}) + \\epsilon_i,\\quad \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2),\\\\\n&= \\mathbf{x}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\epsilon_i,\\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta} &\\sim N(\\mathbf{0}, 100 \\mathbf{I})\\\\\n\\sigma^2 &\\sim \\text{Inv-Gamma}(3,1).\n\\end{align*}\n\n### Exercise 8\n\nObtain samples from the posterior distribution of $(\\boldsymbol{\\beta},\\sigma^2)$ given the observed data. Visualize the posterior distributions and provide justification that the Gibbs sampler has converged. \n\n### Exercise 9\n\nReport the posterior mean, standard deviation, and 95% credible intervals for each parameter.\n\n### Exercise 10\n\nReport the one-sided p-value that corresponds to the statistical hypothesis test: $H_0: \\beta_1 = 0, H_1: \\beta_1 < 0$. Interpret this p-value in the context of the association between smoking and low birth weight.\n\n::: render-commit-push\nYou’re done and ready to submit your work! render, commit, and push all remaining changes.
