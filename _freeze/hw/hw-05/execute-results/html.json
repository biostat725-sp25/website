Researchers are interested in mapping risk of anemia across Sud-Kivu. Anemia is a condition in which the body lacks enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to tissues. It is commonly associated with **low levels of hemoglobin**, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. Anemia can result from malnutrition, especially deficiencies in iron, folate, or vitamin B12, and is linked to a range of negative outcomes including fatigue, impaired cognitive development, weakened immunity, and poor pregnancy outcomes. In children and women, anemia is often a marker of underlying nutritional and health disparities.\n\nTo study anemia, researchers would like to fit a logistic regression model using a Bayesian hierarchical model with spatially varying intercepts. Define $Y_{ij} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ as the indicator of anemia at location $i$ ($i = 1,\\ldots,n$) for participant $j$ ($j = 1,\\ldots, n_i$).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndrc <- drc %>%\n  mutate(anemic = if_else(anemia == \"not anemic\", 0, 1))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe will fit the following model:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nY_j(\\mathbf{u}_i) | \\alpha, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\theta(\\mathbf{u}_i) &\\stackrel{ind}{\\sim} \\text{Bernoulli}(\\pi_{j}(\\mathbf{u}_i))\\\\\n\\text{logit}(\\pi_{j}(\\mathbf{u}_i)) &= \\alpha + \\mathbf{x}_j(\\mathbf{u}_i) \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\theta(\\mathbf{u}_i)\\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\theta} | \\tau,\\rho &\\sim N(\\mathbf{0}_n,\\mathbf{C})\\\\\n\\alpha^* &\\sim N(0,4^2)\\\\\n\\beta_j | \\sigma_{\\beta} &\\sim N(0,\\sigma_{\\beta}^2), \\quad j = 1,\\ldots,p\\\\\n\\tau &\\sim \\text{Half-Normal}(0, 4^2)\\\\\n\\rho &\\sim \\text{Inv-Gamma}(5, 5)\\\\\n\\sigma_{\\beta} &\\sim \\text{Half-Normal}(0, 2^2),\n\\end{align*} where $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = (\\theta(\\mathbf{u}_1),\\ldots,\\theta(\\mathbf{u}_n))^\\top$, $N = \\sum_{i=1}^n n_i = 490$, $n = 29$, $\\mathbf{x}_j(\\mathbf{u}_i) = (\\text{age}_{ij}/10, \\text{urban}_i)$, and $\\mathbf{C}$ a covariance matrix produced using the Matérn 3/2 covariance function with scale parameter $\\tau$ and length scale $\\rho$. The parameter $\\alpha^*$ is the intercept after centering, such that $\\text{logit}(\\pi_{j}(\\mathbf{u}_i)) = \\alpha^* + \\mathbf{x}_j^*(\\mathbf{u}_i) \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\theta(\\mathbf{u}_i)$, where $\\mathbf{x}_j^*(\\mathbf{u}_i) = \\mathbf{x}_j(\\mathbf{u}_i) - \\bar{\\mathbf{x}}_j(\\mathbf{u}_i)$ and $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}_j(\\mathbf{u}_i) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \\mathbf{x}_j(\\mathbf{u}_i)$.\n\n# Exercises\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nBased on [AE-07](https://biostat725-sp25.netlify.app/ae/ae-07-geospatial), process the `drc` data to create an `sf` data object that can be used for spatial analyses. Create a map that visualizes the proportion of participants with anemia at each community in Sud-Kivu.\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nCreate a $25 \\times 25$ grid of points to be used for prediction, and only keep those points within Sud-Kivu. Visualize the grid.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nResearchers are interested in understanding the **a priori** correlation between the anemia probability between two communities across Sud-Kivu. Visualize the correlation as a function of distance between two locations given in miles, evaluated at the prior mean for $\\rho$. What is the a priori correlation between two locations that are 25 miles apart?\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nFit the model detailed above. Present evidence of MCMC convergence.\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nResearchers would like to understand the **a posteriori** correlation between the anemia probability between two communities across Sud-Kivu. Repeat **Exercise 3** using the posterior mean of $\\rho$. Visualize the correlations from the prior and posterior on the same figure. How does the posterior correlation compare to the prior?\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nPresent posterior means and intervals for the odds ratios for age and urbanality. Are any of these predictors associated with anemia?\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nMap the posterior mean probability of anemia across Sud-Kivu, $\\pi(\\mathbf{u}_i)$. To make this map, we must specify $x(\\mathbf{u}_i) = (2.8, 0)$, such that the age is 28 years (average age in Sud-Kivu) and we assume locations are rural (most common community location). Describe any spatial patterns that arise.\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nCreate a map of the posterior standard deviation that corresponds to your map in **Exercise 7**. Describe any spatial patterns that arise.\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nResearchers would like to identify locations in Sud-Kivu where a public health intervention is warranted. The are intrerested in intervening in locations where the posterior probability of anemia is greater than 0.4, $p_i = P(\\pi(\\mathbf{u}_i) > 0.4 | \\mathbf{Y})$. In particular, any locations with $p_i$ greater than 0.5 $\\left(h_i = 1(p_i > 0.5)\\right)$ indicates a hot spot region where intervention is needed. Visualize both the $p_i$ and $h_i$ and make a statement about where intervention is warranted.\n\n# Submission\n\nYou will submit the PDF documents for homeworks, and exams in to Gradescope as part of your final submission.\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo.
