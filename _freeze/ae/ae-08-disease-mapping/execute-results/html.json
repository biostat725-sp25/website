AEs from Tuesday lectures should be submitted by Friday by 11:59pm ET, and AEs from Thursday lectures should be submitted by Sunday at 11:59pm ET. Because AEs are intended for in-class activities, there are no extensions given on AEs.\n\n-   Final `.qmd` and `.pdf` files pushed to your GitHub repo\n-   **Note:** For homeworks and exams, you will also be required to submit your final `.pdf` file submitted on Gradescope\n:::\n\n# Getting Started\n\n## Clone the repo & start new RStudio project\n\n-   Go to the course organization at [github.com/biostat725-sp25](https://github.com/biostat725-sp25) organization on GitHub.\n-   Click on the repo with the prefix **ae-08-**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the AE.\n-   Click on the green **CODE** button, select **Use SSH** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with SSH**). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.\n    -   See the [HW 00 instructions](https://biostat725-sp25.netlify.app/hw/hw-00#connect-rstudio-and-github) if you have not set up the SSH key or configured git.\n-   In RStudio, go to *File* $\\rightarrow$ *New Project* $\\rightarrow$ *Version Control* $\\rightarrow$ *Git*.\n-   Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box *Repository URL*. Again, please make sure to have *SSH* highlighted under *Clone* when you copy the address.\n-   Click *Create Project*, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the *Files* pane in RStudio.\n-   Click `ae-08.qmd` to open the template Quarto file. This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the AE.\n\n# R packages\n\nWe will begin by loading R packages that we will use in this AE.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)     # data wrangling and visualization\nlibrary(knitr)         # format output\nlibrary(rstan)         # Stan\nlibrary(bayesplot)     # figures for post Stan inference\nlibrary(loo)           # model comparison\nlibrary(sf)            # functions to work with spatial data\n# new library\nlibrary(tigris)        # to get boundary information for Durham tracts\nlibrary(spdep)         # compute adjacency matrix\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Data\n\n## The Durham Neighborhood Compass\n\n-   The [Durham Neighborhood Compass](https://compass.durhamnc.gov) is a public data portal developed by the City and County of Durham, NC. It provides **neighborhood-level indicators** across many topics, including: health (e.g., diabetes, asthma), education, housing and development, crime and safety, and demographics and equity. Most indicators are available at the **census tract level**, allowing for spatial analysis of neighborhoods within Durham County. Data are updated regularly and reflect community conditions over time. Today we will focus on adult diabetes prevalence by census tract in 2019. The data is available in `dnc.csv` and can be downloaded directly from the Durham Neighborhood Compass website.\n\nThe variables in the dataset are as follows and are specific to each census tract in 2019.\n\n-   `GEOID`: location id for each census tract.\n\n-   `diabetes`: percentage of adults with diabetes.\n\n-   `education`: percentage of adults with a bachelors degree or higher.\n\n-   `income`: median household income, in \\$10,000.\n\n-   `color`: percentage of people of color.\n\nThe data set is available in your AE repos and is called `dnc`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

These locations correspond to census tracts with a zero residents. For the analysis we will remove them.\n\n# Model Goals\n\nDefine $Y_i$ as the percentage of adults with diabetes in census tract $i$, for $i = 1,\\ldots,n$. There are $n = 57$ census tract in Durham county with a non-zero number of residents. We are interested in producing a map of adult diabetes that has been smoothed using an ICAR process. We want to fit the following model:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nY_i &= \\alpha + \\mathbf{x}_i\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\theta_i + \\epsilon_i, \\quad \\epsilon_i \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} N(0,\\sigma^2)\\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\theta} &\\sim \\text{ICAR}(\\tau^2)\\\\\n\\alpha^* &\\sim N(0, 3^2)\\\\\n\\beta_j &\\sim N(0,3^2)\\quad j = 1,\\ldots,p\\\\\n\\sigma &\\sim \\text{Half-Normal}(0, 3^2)\\\\\n\\tau &\\sim \\text{Half-Normal}(0, 3^2),\n\\end{align*} where $\\mathbf{x}_i = (\\text{education}_i,\\text{income}_i,\\text{color}_i)$ and $\\alpha^*$ is the centered intercept.\n\n## Computing the adjacency matrix\n\nTo fit the model, we required an adjacency matrix, $\\mathbf{W}$. We only want to compute our adjacency matrix for the locations with non-zero residents. Thus, we create a dataset that removes census tracts with `NA` for diabetes.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndurham_model_data <- durham_merged %>%\n  filter(!is.na(diabetes))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe then use functions for the R package `spdep` to create a neighbor list and adjacency matrix.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnb <- poly2nb(durham_model_data)\nW <- nb2mat(nb, style = \"B\", zero.policy = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can visualize the adjacency matrix.
