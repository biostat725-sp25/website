You will also practice handling merge conflicts.\n\n## Learning goals\n\nBy the end of the lab you will be able to\n\n-   conduct exploratory data analysis for logistic regression\n-   fit logistic regression models and write the regression equation\n-   use the model to calculate predicted probabilities\n-   continue developing a collaborative workflow with your teammates\n-   develop strategies for dealing with merge conflicts\n\n## Merge Conflicts (uh oh)\n\n![Collaboration with no merge conflict](images/06/merge-no-conflict.png)\n\n![Collaboration with a merge conflict](images/06/merge-conflict.png)\n\nYou may have seen something like the image above through the course of your collaboration. When two collaborators make changes to a file and push the file to their repository, git merges these two files.\n\nIf these two files have conflicting content on the same line, git will produce a **merge conflict**. Merge conflicts need to be resolved manually, as they require a human intervention:\n\n![Merge conflict identifiers](images/06/merge-conflict-identifiers.png)\n\nTo resolve the merge conflict, decide if you want to keep only your text, the text on GitHub, or incorporate changes from both texts. Delete the conflict markers `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` and make the changes you want in the final merge.\n\n**Assign numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 to each of your team members** (if only 3 team members, just number 1 through 3). Go through the following steps in detail, which simulate a merge conflict. Completing this exercise will be part of the lab grade.\n\n### Resolving a merge conflict\n\n**Step 1: Everyone** clone the **merge-conflict** assignment repo in RStudio and open file **merge-conflict.Rmd**.\n\n**Member 4** should look at the group's repo on GitHub.com to ensure that the other members' files are pushed to GitHub after every step.\n\n**Step 2: Member 1** Change the team name to your team name. *Render, commit, and push*.\n\n**Step 3: Member 2** Change the team name to something different (i.e., not your team name). *Render, commit, and push*.\n\nYou should get an error.\n\n**Pull** and review the document with the merge conflict. Read the error to your teammates. You can also show them the error by sharing your screen. A merge conflict occurred because you edited the same part of the document as Member 1. Resolve the conflict with whichever name you want to keep, then render, commit and push again.\n\n**Step 4: Member 3** Write some narrative in the space provided. You should get an error.\n\nThis time, no merge conflicts should occur, since you edited a different part of the document from Members 1 and 2. Read the error to your teammates. You can also show them the error by sharing your screen.\n\nClick to pull. Then *render, commit, and push.*\n\n**Please ask your TA if you have any questions about merge conflicts and collaborating in GitHub.**\n\n## Getting started\n\n-   A repository has already been created for you and your teammates. Everyone in your team has access to the same repo.\n\n-   Go to the [sta210-fa23](https://github.com/sta210-fa23) organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-05**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\n\n-   Each person on the team should clone the repository and open a new project in RStudio. Throughout the lab, each person should get a chance to make commits and push to the repo.\n\n-   **Do not make any changes to the `.qmd` file until the instructions tell you do to so.**\n\n## Workflow: Using Git and GitHub as a team\n\n::: callout-important\nThere are no Team Member markers in this lab; however, you should use a similar workflow as in Lab 04. Only one person should type in the group's .qmd file at a time. Once that person has finished typing the group's responses, they should *render, commit, and push* the changes to GitHub. All other teammates can *pull* to see the updates in RStudio.\n\nEvery teammate must have at least one commit in the lab. Everyone is expected to contribute to discussion even when they are not typing.\n:::\n\n## Packages\n\nThe following packages are used in the lab.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n# add other packages as needed\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data: Palmer Penguins\n\nWe will go back to the Palmer penguins data used in [HW 02.](../hw/hw-02.html)\n\nData were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/). [@gorman2014]\n\n\\\nThese data can be found in the **palmerpenguins** package. We're going to be working with the `penguins` dataset from this package. The dataset contains data for 344 penguins. There are 3 different species of penguins in this dataset, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. [Click here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html) to see the codebook.\n\nWe will focus on the following variables:\\\n\n| variable            | class   | description                                 |\n|:--------------------|:--------|:--------------------------------------------|\n| `species`           | integer | Penguin species (Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap) |\n| `body_mass_g`       | integer | Body mass in g                              |\n| `flipper_length_mm` | integer | Flipper length in mm                        |\n\n## Exercises\n\nThe goal of this analysis is to use logistic regression to understand the relationship between flipper length, island, and whether a penguin is considered large. ***Let's assume a penguin is considered large if it has an above average body mass.*** First, remove missing values and create a new response variable to identify whether a penguin is large.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npenguins <- penguins |>\n  drop_na() |>\n  mutate(large = factor(if_else(body_mass_g > mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE), 1, 0)))\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd let's make sure the new variable looks how we would expect before we continue with the analysis. Note the mean body mass for the penguins in the data is 4207.057 grams.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npenguins |> \n  group_by(large) |>\n  summarise(min = min(body_mass_g), mean = mean(body_mass_g), max = max(body_mass_g))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  large   min  mean   max\n  <fct> <int> <dbl> <int>\n1 0      2700 3605.  4200\n2 1      4250 4988.  6300\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 1\n\nLet's start by examining the relationship between `large` and `species`.\n\nVisualize the relationship between `large` and `species`. Write something you observe about the relationship between these two variables based on the plot.\n\n### Exercise 2\n\n-   Calculate the **probability** a randomly selected penguin is large, given that it is from the Adelie species.\n\n-   Calculate the **odds** a randomly selected penguin is large, given it is from the Adelie speices.\n\n### Exercise 3\n\nSplit the data into a 75% training set, `penguins_train`, and 25% test set, `penguins_test`. Use a seed of `29`. We will be using the training set throughout the assignment for modeling and the test set to assess the performance.\n\n### Exercise 4\n\nYou want to fit a model using `species` to predict the odds a penguins is large. Let $\\pi$ be the probability a penguin is large. The model has the form shown below.\n\n$$\n\\log\\Big(\\frac{\\pi}{1-\\pi}\\Big) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1~ Chinstrap + \\beta_2 ~ Gentoo\n$$\n\n-   Fit the model using the training data and neatly display the model output using three digits.\n-   What are the predicted **odds** of a penguin being large if it is Gentoo?\n-   What are the predicted **odds** of a penguin being large if it is Adelie?\n\n### Exercise 5\n\nNext, we'd like to add flipper length to the model. We'll start by examining the relationship between these two variables.\n\n-   Visualize the relationship between `flipper_length_mm` and `large`. What is something you observe about the relationship between these two variables from the plot?\n\n-   Add flipper length to the model from Exercise 4 so that there are two predictors, `species` and `flipper_length_mm`. Neatly display the model output using three digits.\n\n-   Write the estimated regression equation.\n\n### Exercise 6\n\nUse the model from Exercise 5.\n\n-   How do you expect the **log-odds** of being a large penguin to change when going from a penguin with flipper length 185 mm to a penguin with flipper length 200 mm? Assume both penguins are of the Gentoo species.\n\n-   How do you expect the **odds** of being a large penguin to change when going from a penguin with flipper length 185 mm to a penguin with flipper length 200 mm? Assume both penguins are of the Gentoo species.\n\n### Exercise 7\n\nUse the model from Exercise 5.\n\n-   How do you expect the **log-odds** of being a large penguin to change when going from a penguin with flipper length 195 mm recorded as Chinstrap to a penguin with flipper length 210 mm recorded as Adelie?\n\n-   How do you expect the **odds** of being a large penguin to change when going from a penguin with flipper length 195 mm recorded as Chinstrap to a penguin with flipper length 210 mm recorded as Adelie?\n\n### Exercise 8\n\nNow let's assess the performance of both models on the test set.\n\n-   Use `predict()` function to get the predicted class for the observations in the `penguins_test` based on the model from Exercise 4. Calculate the percentage of observations that were mislcassified.\n\n-   Use the `predict()` function to get the predicted class for the observations in `penguins_test` based on the model from Exercise 5. Calculate the percentage of observations that were mislcassified.\n\n-   Based on this analysis, which model would you select? Briefly explain.\n\n## Submission\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo.
